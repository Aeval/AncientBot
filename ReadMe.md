<h1>AncientBot Beta 0.1.0<h2>

This bot is meant for use in discords within the Dota 2 community.

In this version it has:

!ping: Displays server and API ping

!stats [match ID #]: Returns very basic stats about the game in a neat little embed complete with the winning team's symbol*

Symbols for Radiant and Dire are wonderfully done by Ellie Rebecca Thorpe, so a big thank you to her!
