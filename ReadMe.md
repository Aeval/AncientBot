<h1>AncientBot Beta 0.1.0</h1>

This bot is meant for use in discords within the Dota 2 community.

In this version it has:

* !ping: Displays server and API ping

* !stats [match ID #]: Returns very basic stats about the game in a neat little embed complete with the winning team's symbol



**Symbols for Radiant and Dire are wonderfully done by _Ellie Rebecca Thorpe_, so a big thank you to her!**
